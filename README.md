# unu Scooter Pro - Technical Documentation

Reverse-engineered technical documentation of the unu Scooter Pro.

## About this version

You are reading `dev`, which tracks the `main` branch of this repository and
describes the current state of the code, including work that has not shipped in
any release yet. For what a released image actually contains, pick that version
from the selector above.

## System Architecture

The unu Scooter Pro uses a distributed architecture with several key systems:

### Core Electronics
- **Middle Driver Board (MDB)** - Central control system
  - Manages power distribution and system communications
  - Coordinates motor control and battery management
  - Provides cellular connectivity via SIM7100E module
  - USB gadget, connected to DBC, exposes USB Ethernet
  - Handles wakeup/sleep states

- **Dashboard Controller (DBC)**
  - Freescale i.MX6 processor
  - Manages display and user interface
  - NFC reader for keycard authentication
  - USB host, connected to MDB

- **Electronic Control Unit (ECU)**
  - BOSCH/Lingbo motor controller
    - unu 4kW: 4kW peak / 2.7kW continuous
    - unu 3kW: 3kW peak / 1.9kW continuous
  - Encrypted CAN bus communication
  - Controls motor and regenerative braking

### Power Systems
- **Main Battery System**
  - 14s7p configuration using INR22/71-7 cells
  - 50.8V nominal, 58.2V max charging voltage
  - 35Ah/1778Wh capacity
  - NFC communication for data channel
  - LED status ring

- **Auxiliary Power**
  - 12V auxiliary lead-acid battery for core systems
  - DC/DC converter for system power
  - Connectivity Box Battery (CBB, Lithium-Ion) for cellular/GPS

### Communication Interfaces
- **Bluetooth LE** - Local device connectivity
  - Service UUIDs documented in [Bluetooth Docs](bluetooth/README.md)
  - Device control and status monitoring
  - Firmware updates over BLE ([OTA transfer protocol](bluetooth/ota-transfer.md))

- **Cellular** - Remote connectivity
  - SIM7100E module on MDB
  - Remote diagnostics and updates
  - User app connectivity

- **Redis** - Internal communication
  - Runs on 192.168.7.1:6379 (MDB)
  - Inter-process communication
  - System state management
  - [Full Redis documentation](redis/README.md)

### MDB network support

The MDB kernel includes TUN, IPv4 and IPv6 policy routing, and the netfilter mark matcher needed for Tailscale networking. This support does not install or enroll a Tailscale daemon.

### NFC reader configuration

The MDB device tree maps the three PN7150 readers' supply inputs to a fixed always-on regulator. The optional FIRM and CLKREQ GPIOs are absent and logged at debug level; required enable and interrupt GPIO failures remain errors. Wake and power-control GPIO behavior is unchanged.

### Managed hostnames

MDB and DBC initialize a missing or empty managed hostname boot hook from CFG1. The boot-time synchronization replaces only the exact legacy CFG0 hook for that board; customized commands remain unchanged. The changed hook takes effect on the next boot after synchronization. DNS, SSH configuration, monitoring and log searches that use the generated hostname may need adjustment. SSH host keys and the fixed-address `mdb` and `dbc` aliases do not change.

### Hardware Details

Detailed documentation available for:

- [Electronic Systems](electronic/README.md)
- [Mechanical Components](mechanical/README.md)
- [Wiring & Connectors](wiring/README.md)

## Software Services

The MDB runs several system services that coordinate vehicle operations. For detailed documentation of each service, see [Services Documentation](services/README.md).

### Librescoot Services

Librescoot provides open-source replacement firmware for unu Scooter Pro systems, including:

- **Core System Services**: alarm, battery, bluetooth, ECU, keycard, modem, power management, settings, vehicle
- **Dashboard Services**: backlight control, illumination monitoring
- **Update Services**: OTA updates, version tracking
- **Communication Services**: nRF52 UART protocol

For complete Librescoot service documentation, see [Librescoot Services](services/README.md).

## System States

The scooter operates in several power states:

- Hibernating
- Booting
- Stand-By
- Parked
- Ready
- Shutting Down

State transitions are triggered by:

- User actions (lock/unlock)
- Power management events
- System commands

[Detailed state diagrams and transitions](states/README.md)

## Command-Line Tools

### lsc - Librescoot Control CLI

`lsc` is a comprehensive command-line tool for controlling and monitoring Librescoot systems. It provides easy access to:

- Vehicle control (lock/unlock, hibernate)
- Service management (start/stop/logs)
- Battery and GPS monitoring
- Alarm system control
- Settings management
- OTA updates
- System diagnostics

See [lsc documentation](tools/lsc.md) for complete command reference.

**Quick examples:**
```bash
lsc status              # Show overall system status
lsc lock                # Lock the scooter
lsc battery             # Show battery information
lsc svc list            # List all services
lsc svc logs vehicle -f # Follow vehicle service logs
```

## Development Access

- MDB UART, Pin 1 = GND, Pin 2 = TXD, Pin 3 = RXD
